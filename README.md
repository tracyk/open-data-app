An Interactive Application helping users locate various Volleyball Courts accross Ottawa.

**Description**
Ottawa Mapped is an application which integrates Google maps to allow users to find volleyball courts across 
Ottawa. Using google maps, this application tracks volleyball courts using longitute, latitute and an address. 

The user will also be able to review and rate all the volleyball courts to allow other users to compare all the data available 
on ottawa mapped. 

**Installation**

The application can be run directly from [phpfog] (https://github.com/tracyk/open-data-app), however 
if the application is running directly on your laptop it will require two elements:
1) A server like mamp or wamp
2) A db file. This file will generate passwords allowing the servers to access the application

A username and password must also be added to the database to access the administration section.
